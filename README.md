Handy Purge
------------

This is a quick tool for running the 'purge' command on your mac.

Running purge frees up memory that might have been held up and not released once a program has been exited. Running this after closing a few large memory apps can make your system feel like it's just been rebooted!

Handy Purge lives in the status bar and has a small menu, so execution is simple.

### TODOs

Soon I hope to add the ability to run the app on startup
